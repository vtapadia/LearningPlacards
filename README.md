## Introduction
Placards, we all have created during our study.
The project started from a need while I am trying to learn a language. Somethimes, one just needs simple placards to manage the difficult words.
Initially I used a paper, thanks to my daughter, but that just lead to so many words that I did not know.

So, the birth of this project. A simple project where one can create cards and practive them

Nothing fancy, no cloud, nothing saved on server, just on your device. 

Simple cards to practice the words, if you know it, you can delete it.
